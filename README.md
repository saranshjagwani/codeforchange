## üö© Problem Statement
Waste segregation and collection in India is largely unorganized and inefficient, with limited awareness and incentives for users to dispose of waste properly. There's no streamlined system to detect, categorize, and reward proper disposal of all types of waste.

**EcoBin** addresses this by:
- Detecting and categorizing different types of waste using AI.
- Offering coin-based rewards (convertible to discounts or money).
- Encouraging sustainable habits through eco-friendly alternatives and upcycled products.
- Connecting users, collectors, and sellers in a transparent waste-to-value marketplace.
